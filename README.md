# Django

### Pre-requisites: Virtual Environments in Python
A Python virtual environment is an isolated environment in which you can run and manage Python projects and their dependencies. Virtual environments are essential tools in Python development because they help keep dependencies required by different projects in separate places. This isolation avoids conflicts between projects, especially when different projects require different versions of the same package.

To create a virtual environment you run the following command:
```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

To activate the environment you run:
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```
